# Custom themes for SAS Studio 3

SAS Studio version 3 has a bright white theme with no built-in options to customize it. E.g., there is no dark theme. This repository provides CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files to change the theme, including colors and the font of the code editor. These themes have been tested on Chrome and Edge in SAS Studio 3.8 (released Nov 2018) and 3.82 (released Jan 2023).

To use, first install a browser extension that enables loading custom CSS. Many such extensions exist for a range of browsers.
