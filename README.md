# Custom themes for SAS Studio 3

SAS Studio version 3 has a bright white theme with no built-in options to customize it. E.g., there is no dark theme. This repository provides CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files to change the theme, including colors and the font of the code editor. These themes have been tested in SAS Studio 3.8 and 3.82.

To use, first install the [Stylus browser extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), available for Chrome, Edge (via Chrome), and Firefox. Then click a link below to install one of the themes. You can install more than one theme and toggle between them as desired.
